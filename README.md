# selfbot

Welcome to my project!
I made this Discord selfbot in Node.js using Discord.js
You can use it for your own.

Requirements:

Node.js installed
discord.js installed in the folder

---

If you have all requirements, hop over to the config.json file. When you are there, replace the the "ownerID" with your user ID. 
Replace the "token" with your token.
And if you want, you can change the prefix. You can always change this from Discord with `prefix`setprefix <new prefix>.
