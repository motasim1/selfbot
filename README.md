# selfbot

Welcome to my project!
I made this Discord selfbot in Node.js using Discord.js
You can use it for your own.

Requirements:

Node.js installed

discord.js installed in the folder (run `npm install discord.js --save` in the folder)

---

If you have all requirements, hop over to the config.json file. When you are there, replace the "ownerID" with your user ID. 
Replace the "token" with your token.
And if you want, you can change the prefix. You can always change this from Discord with `prefix`setprefix <new prefix here>.

---

How to start the bot:

1. First, install Node.js
2. Then, you need to have an editor. (I use Atom)
3. Change the config.json file so it works for you
4. Open up a terminal in your folder and run `npm install discord.js --save` (works only when Node.js is installed and without this, your bot won't work)
5. Run in a terminal `npm install -g nodemon` (This is to restart the bot automatically and it is usefull)
6. Now, open the file "launch.bat" and you are ready to go!

If you did everything correct, you will see this in your terminal: 

Selfbot is online! 
Prefix: `your setted prefix in the config file`

Logged in as: `your discord username#your discord discriminator`

Use: `your setted prefix in the config file`help

If you get any errors or if you have any problems/questions, feel free to open an issue. i will take asap contact with you and try to help you out. Questions about the code will I ignore. Problems that are listed here above will I ignore
